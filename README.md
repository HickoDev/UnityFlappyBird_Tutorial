# Developing the Game
Once the project is open, let's familiarize ourselves with the Unity Editor interface. Here's an overview of the main components:

**Toolbar**: Located at the top, it provides access to essential features like Play mode controls, Unity Cloud Services, and the Editor layout menu.

**Hierarchy Window**: Displays a hierarchical text representation of every GameObject in the current Scene. It reveals the structure of how GameObjects attach to each other.

**Scene View**: Allows you to visually navigate and edit your Scene. It can display a 3D or 2D perspective, depending on your project type.

**Game View**: Simulates what your final rendered game will look like through your Scene Cameras.

**Inspector Window :** Enables you to view and edit all properties of the currently selected GameObject. The layout and contents change based on the selected object.

**Project Window:** Shows your library of Assets available for use in your Project. Imported Assets appear here.

**Console Window:** Displays output from your game, such as debug messages, warnings, and errors.
